Mission 1: Write a program which fulfills the requirements below
Description

    We want to calculate a sum of squares of some integers, excepting negatives
    The first line of the input will be an integer N (1 <= N <= 100)
    Each of the following N test cases consist of one line containing an integer X (X <= 100), followed by X integers space-separated on the next line
    For each test case, calculate the sum of squares of the integers excepting negatives, and print the calculated sum to the output. No blank line between test cases
    (Take input from standard input, and output to standard output)

Rules

    Choose your favorite language from either of these: C, Erlang, Go, Python, Ruby
    Do not use loop statements like while/until/for/each/loop
